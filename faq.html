          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Privateer is a modern and transparent approach to selling real estate, saving its clients over $22,000 on average in commission fees.  Privateer gives you the confidence, products and services to execute a successful sale campaign yourself.

          <div class="collapsible-header">Why choose Privateer over an agent?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Trade Me has revolutionised the way we find property.  It is a database of all properties on the market irrespective of which company is selling it. Whilst you remain in control of the total process Privateer will walk you through from photography to a signed sale and purchase agreement at a fraction of the cost.

          <div class="collapsible-header">How does Privateer work?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              We work with you to sell your home.  Weather you engage us to host a bunch of open homes, put up a street front sign or discuss a recent offer, we are on your side.

          <div class="collapsible-header">Some agents claim to have a buyer in hand?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Heard it before all before!  If their buyer is interested in buying property they will be looking on Trade Me.  Most motivated buyers will have registered alert systems set to identify new properties on the market, in any given area and price range.

        <li>
          <div class="collapsible-header">Can I use an agent and Privateer?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Yes you can.  It is common to see a property listed with multiple agents. We suggest you list your property using our services and engage an agent once your campaign has started to ensure ownership amongst buyers.
            </p>

          <div class="collapsible-header">What do I say when a buyer asks “how much?”</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              It depends.  Your sales strategy (Auction, Asking Price, Enquiries over etc) will determine the right answer.  We can prepare you in how to deal with most circumstances in a controlled and effective manner.
            </p>

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Selling property independent of a real estate agent is easy. We can help you put in place a strategy which is most suited to you and guide you through the process from start to finish.

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              As soon as photography is in hand, we can have you listed and ready for sale in a day or two.

          <div class="collapsible-header">How are your fees so low?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Fewer overheads.  Large High St offices are not required to sell your home.  We simple provide you what you need to sell your home, nothing more.

          <div class="collapsible-header">Will you do the negotiating for me?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Short answer is no.  We can prepare and direct you in your negotiation process as well as suggest strategies and techniques to ensure the best outcome.

          <div class="collapsible-header">Are floorplans important?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              It is proved, people spend 35% more time on listings with a floorplan than those that don’t.

              Let us show it for you.  Our professional service will welcome buyers through your home and will provide you a detailed registration of attendees after the open home.

          <div class="collapsible-header">Is the legal stuff to hard?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Not at all!  The legal element is only a small part of selling your home and in the vast majority of cases a very straight forward process.  We can provide recommended conveyancers to service your legal requirements.

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              We will provide you all the sales data in your area so you can compare your house to others recently sold.  If you’re thinking about putting your house on the market, we suggest you take an interest in any current local sales and note how they are being sold and for how much.  This will give you a better understanding and realistic approach to setting your price.

              <p>
                Refreshingly surprised. Most buyers prefer to deal directly with the owner of a property.
